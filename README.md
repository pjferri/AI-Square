# AI-Square Description
Watch as the square learns to navigate from one corner of the map to the other. The AI's current position is marked with a dot and it will leave a trail as it goes. When it reaches the end, the program will close itself.

# Run Instructions
This project is using numpy, matplotlib, and the sklearn libraries which will need to be installed before running. This can be done with the pip installer.
The actual project is contained in AI7.py file so that's the one you want to run, the rest are my previous iterations of the project.
